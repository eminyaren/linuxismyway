<p>Last month, I was looking for a cheap laptop with good Gpu, Cpu and good amount of Ram. I searched on internet for a while, Ryzen models was looking good and I found Lenovo v155-15api on hepsiburada.com. It had Ryzen 3500U Apu with 12 GB ram.</p>

<pre><code>Lenovo V155-15
</code></pre>
<p>My purpose was running Davinci Resolve and Blender 3D for video editing and 3D animations and my budget was very limited (around 500$) so I have decided to buy it. It has come without any OS. So I had two options; Windows and Linux to work with.</p>
<p>I am a Linux person so I would install a Linux distro but I had some limitations:</p>
<ol>
<li>It had to support AmdGpu-Pro drivers for OpenCl support. (Because I had decided to buy a Ryzen Laptop)</li>
<li>It should have run Davinci Resolve without any problems.</li>
<li>It had to be stable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then my Journey has begun:</p>
<ul>
<li>My first option was Ubuntu 20.04 so I installed it. Installation was great then I installed gpu drivers. When I restarted the computer, the screen was black. it was a disappointment.</li>
<li>After Ubuntu I decided to installed Debian because I had already knew that it was a very stable distro. But it could not even start. I could reach the tty1 so I have tried to install AmdGpu drivers but there was no chence.</li>
<li>Next stop was Fedora but I did not even try it, I had known that amd was not support it officially.</li>
<li>My last option was CentOS. It was installed perfectly. I installed Amd drivers and it worked well. Then I installed Davinci and Blender 3D, they worked perfect. CentOS installation and Amd driver installation was very very smooth and clean, I had no problems with them. Only problem for me is its repository, it is very limited, kernel is bit old (4.18) and programs are too. For exemple Gimp version is 2.8, Blender 3D version is 2.79 etc. But Flatpaks are there so I would have no problems with newer programs in my opinion.</li>
</ul>

</code></pre>
<p><img src="/img/blender_on_centos.png" alt="Blender"></p>
<pre><code>Blender is working perfect!
</code></pre>
<p>As result, CentOS on Lenovo V155-15api with vega 8 graphics is working perfect for me. Lenovo V155-15api cheap, fast and reliable computer for CentOS.</p>
